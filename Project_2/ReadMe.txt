A project report by:

Srikumar Muralidharan

The code folder contains the following files:
1. Problem1.py
2. Project2_challengevideo.py
3. Project2_dataset1.py

We can run any of these codes and obtain the results posted in the video output. Sample outputs are added in the Report
Please make sure to place the dataset files in the same folder where the programs are kept.

***Special note for Project2_dataset1 code:
Before running the program, make sure to specify the location of the directory where the dataset images are present. 
LINE 121 contains the code where it specifies the directory for the dataset.

For example,
r"C:\Users\prade\OneDrive\Documents\UMD_Robotics\Courses\ENPM 673 - Perception\Project2\data_1-20200307T183325Z-001\data_1\data\*.png"

Copy and paste the location of the directory,
r"location_of_your_direcrtory/*.png"

Please don't hesitate to contact me if there is any problem in running the code.
